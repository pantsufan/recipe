1. Marinate the fish in salt and lime (half a lime) juice for 10 minutes.
2. In the meanwhile, grind all the masalas together. Add a little bit of water to adjust the consistency.
3. Add the onions and green chillies to the masala. Add this mix to a pan and place it over the flame.
4. Keep the masala over the flame for about 10 minutes (two boils) and keep stirring to prevent it from burning.
5. Once done, add the marinated fish to this masala. Add some water to adjust the consistency of the curry.
6. Let it cook till one boil. (In case you use fish with bone cook up till two or three boils).
7. Serve hot. It tastes best with unpolished Goan rice.
